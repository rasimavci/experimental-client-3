## Introduction
In this applicaton I tried to build a mobile webRTC client using mintUI library along with vue and vuex

After all, I learned Vue for a while, and I tried to be familier more about the Vue ecosystem and after reading some guides in their official site, I just want to try my chance.

So I decided to build this new mobile client

## Development
This project can be developed using necessary libraries
**please install node.js if you have not yet**
**please deploy kandy.js API first**


## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
